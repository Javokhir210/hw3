I have created 5 pages with different widgets. In page one I have used an icon, text, text field, 
button to go to the next page and also a message which is changed every time the button is pressed in every
page. The message is saved in ScreenData class with info variable. Update message method is used to update the 
info message. Then in the main I used provider for that. Additionally, I have used images also. You can go 
forward or backward among the pages by pressing corresponding buttons. In page 4 i have added 4 containers 
with math problems. You can write answers in the text fields. That is it, I have completed the assignment 
according to requirements.
